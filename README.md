This program is easily accessible by just downloading Python. Python and Windows together come with many tools! To run this code: Save the Script by downloading it onto your device. You will then need to copy it on to your C Drive. 
Once that is complete, open up a command window, and type: Python Password_Strength.py to run the Script. This will launch the Graphic User Interface where you can interact with the app!
The GUI will have on display the Password Entry Box, the Strength Bar, Check Password Button, a copy of the last password entered, the Password Generate Button, and a Button that allows you to copy to clip board! 
Once you enter a password, the application will provide you with whether or not your password is strong enough and/or what is needed to make it stronger!
